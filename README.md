# BlueToothDEMO
This is the demo that comes with a bluetooth thermal printer ported to Android Studio.

The bluetooth thermal printer used is this one:

The model on the back says SC28 but on the self-test print another info is displayed:

`M58-LL Thermal Printer, version M58.E-Z02-AB`

Anyways, the box comes with an Eclipse source code which needed to be converted. After some trial and error, we got it working so we decided to share it.

Feel free to use it as a start point for your project.


Good luck,
